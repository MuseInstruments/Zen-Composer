# Zen-Composer
Software for the Zen Composer--
You should be able to past this into an open program on the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
and download it to the Zen Composer Chip (a Teensy 4.0).  You will need to add the Teensyduino software to 
the Arduino IDE (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
You will also need the Sparkfun LIS3DH libray here (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lis3dh-hookup-guide#getting-the-arduino-library) or in the Arduino library manager (as of this writing the Adafruit version did not work).  Note there are three parts to the program publishversion20, zzboyd, and zzzfunction that are to be placed in a folder publishversion20 and then opened together where they will appear as diffrent tabs in an Arduino IDE window.
