# Zen-Composer
Software for the Zen Composer--
You should be able to past this into an open program on the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
and download it to the Zen Composer Chip (a Teensy 4.0).  You will need to add the Teensyduino software to 
the Arduino IDE (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
You will also need the Sparkfun LIS3DH libray here (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lis3dh-hookup-guide#getting-the-arduino-library) or in the Arduino library manager
